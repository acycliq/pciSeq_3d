"""
Builds docs/api/code-map.md, the code map, from the pciSeq source.

Two parts. The top is a hand-kept table, MAP below, that goes from a component
of the model (theta, the spatial term, ...) to the functions that compute it. The
rest is generated: every module, class and function under pciSeq/src with its
line and the first line of its docstring, so nothing can be left out. The test
in tests/test_docs_in_sync.py checks that every name in MAP exists and that the
committed page is what this script produces now.

The page is for two readers: a person finding their way round the repo, and the
agent in the viewer chat, which reads the docs first and then the source at the
commit that made the run; with the map it opens the right file at the right line
instead of paging through main.py.

Run it from the website/ folder:  python gen_code_map.py
The deploy workflow runs it too, right before vitepress builds. Standard library
only, it parses the source and does not import the package.
