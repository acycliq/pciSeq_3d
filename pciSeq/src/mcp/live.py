"""Tools for asking about a run while it is still running.

The finished-run tools (tools.py) read diagnostics.db, which does not exist until
the run ends. These read the VarBayes object in memory, so they answer the
questions only a live run can raise: how far has it got, is it converging, what is
this cell right now, what changed since the last iteration.

They are plain functions over a VarBayes, as tools.py is plain functions over a
Run: the live viewer's chat is a thin wrapper, and a notebook can call them just as
well while a fit runs in another thread.

Three rules, the same as the finished-run tools:
  1. cell labels in and out are the labels of the segmentation, never internal.
  2. counts are soft, weighted by assignment probability, and every answer says so.
  3. row 0 of the arrays is the background pseudocell, never reported.

Everything here is a snapshot: the loop keeps iterating while the agent reads, so
two answers in one conversation can come from different iterations. Every answer
carries the iteration it was taken at, and the agent is told to quote it.

        The model being fitted. Held by reference, never copied: the point is to
        see the current state, not a stale one.

    -----
    The history of what each cell was called is not kept by the model, so
    `remember()` has to be called once per iteration for the movement tools to
    have anything to compare against. The live viewer calls it from the same
