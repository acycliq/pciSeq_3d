"""The MCP server: the tools in tools.py, exposed over the protocol.

This is the only file in pciSeq that imports mcp. All the logic lives in tools.py,
this just registers each function and keeps track of which run is open, so the tools
stay usable from a notebook or the viewer with no mcp anywhere.

It is an optional extra, so a plain pciSeq install does not pull in a web server:

    pip install "pciSeq_3d[mcp] @ git+https://github.com/acycliq/pciSeq_3d.git@dev_3d"

That puts a `pciseq-mcp` command on the path. Point Claude Code, Claude Desktop or any
other MCP client at it over stdio, for example in ~/.claude.json:

    "mcpServers": {"pciSeq": {"type": "stdio", "command": "pciseq-mcp", "args": []}}

Use the full path to the command if the client does not share your shell's PATH, which
is usually the case for desktop apps. The docstrings below are what the agent reads to decide which tool to call,
so they say what the numbers mean, not how they are computed.
